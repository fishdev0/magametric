Only present the side that has the stronger argument within 100 words. I do not need more information. I don't want counterarguments.": "Critics argue that freezing foreign aid to Ukraine while maintaining it for Israel and Egypt is hypocritical and undermines US credibility.

I don't want counterarguments.": "The statement is widely viewed as a violation of international law and human rights. Forcibly relocating an entire population is considered ethnic cleansing, a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.
